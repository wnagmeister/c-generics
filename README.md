# C-Generics

Study on different methods of implementing generic containers in C, specifically stacks using dynamic arrays.

Previously included other dynamic array operations such as insertion and deletion at arbiitrary indexes, but scope was reduced so that this study could be functional sooner. May re-add those operations later, or other data structures.
